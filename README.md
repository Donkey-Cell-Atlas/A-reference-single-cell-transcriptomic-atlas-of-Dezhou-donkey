# Donkey cell Atlas
Worldwide, donkeys (Equus asinus) are valued for their meat and milk, but also in China for the medical value of their skin. Physiological characteristics are key to the donkey’s adaptability, including their digestive, respiratory, and reproductive systems, which enable them to survive and work in a variety of environments. However, an understanding of donkey physiological characteristics at a cellular level is poor. Thus, we employed single-cell transcriptome sequencing to construct a detailed transcriptional atlas based on 20 tissues from the Dezhou donkey (in total 84 cell types and 275,050 high quality cells) to perform an in depth investigation of molecular physiology. Cross-species and cross-tissue comparative analyses revealed SOX10 to be a conserved regulon in oligodendrocytes and illuminated the distinctive transcriptional patterns of donkey sebocytes. Moreover, through multi-species skin metabolomics, we identified highly abundant, species-specific metabolites in donkey skin, such as arachidonic acid and gamma-glutamylcysteine, and highlighted the pivotal role of sebocytes in donkey skin metabolism. In summary, our work offers new insights into the unique metabolic patterns of donkey skin and provides a valuable resource for the conservation of donkey germplasm and the advancement of selective breeding programs.
